# kyc_clients_risk_detection_2024

Project Overview

This project analyzes real-world bank marketing data collected during phone-based marketing campaigns. The main objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics.

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data science workflow:
* data understanding and cleaning,

* exploratory data analysis (EDA),

* feature engineering and preprocessing,

* machine learning modeling and evaluation,

* interpretation of results from a business perspective.

The dataset contains anonymized client information.
